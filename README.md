Simulation package for photon scatter on a dust shell, where multiple
scattering is taken into account.  Dust scattering and absorption properties 
are included for the Milky Way and the Large and Small Magellanic clouds
(as described in Drain 2003).

Output is stored in fits files, and includes the number of interactions as
well as the total integrated path for each photon before it exits the shell. 

A monochromatic light source is assumed.  The output can be convolved with
different (time-varying) spectral shapes in order to study diffent observed
spectral sequences.
